# Solution Guide - Payment Processor Refactoring

## Issues in Original Code (10+ violations)

### OOP Violations

1. **Poor Encapsulation**
   - Public `apiKey` field exposes sensitive data
   - Direct access to `processedTransactions` list allows external modification
   - No proper getters/setters with validation

2. **Missing Abstraction**
   - No abstract payment method interface
   - Concrete implementations mixed with business logic
   - No separation between payment processing logic and infrastructure

3. **No Polymorphism**
   - Uses if-else chains instead of polymorphic behavior
   - Cannot easily add new payment types without modifying existing code

### SOLID Violations

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ❌
   - Class handles: payment processing, validation, logging, email, HTTP requests, fee calculation, discounts
   - At least 7 different responsibilities in one class
   - Should be split into separate classes with single responsibilities

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ❌
   - Adding new payment type requires modifying the `processPayment` method
   - if-else chain must be extended for each new type
   - Not open for extension, requires modification

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ❌
   - No inheritance hierarchy to demonstrate, but opportunity missed
   - Could have payment method subtypes that are substitutable

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** ❌
   - No interfaces defined
   - Clients forced to depend on entire monolithic class
   - No focused contracts for different concerns

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** ❌
   - Depends on concrete implementations (File I/O, HTTP calls)
   - No dependency injection
   - Hardcoded dependencies throughout
   - High-level logic coupled to low-level details

### Design Pattern Opportunities

1. **Strategy Pattern** - For different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer)
2. **Factory Pattern** - For creating appropriate payment processors
3. **Observer Pattern** - For payment notifications and logging
4. **Repository Pattern** - For transaction storage and retrieval
5. **Chain of Responsibility** - For validation steps
6. **Decorator Pattern** - For fee calculation and discount application

### Code Quality Issues

1. Hardcoded API keys and file paths (security risk)
2. Poor error handling (just print statements, no exceptions)
3. Massive code duplication across payment types
4. No proper return types or error objects
5. Mixed concerns in single method (validation + processing + logging + notification)
6. No unit testability (tightly coupled dependencies)
7. Synchronous file I/O in main flow
8. No async/await for HTTP calls

## Key Improvements to Implement

### 1. Strategy Pattern for Payment Methods
```dart
abstract class PaymentMethod {
  Future<PaymentResult> process(PaymentRequest request);
  void validate(Map<String, dynamic> details);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
  final HttpService _httpService;
  
  CreditCardPayment(this._httpService);
  
  @override
  Future<PaymentResult> process(PaymentRequest request) async {
    // Implementation specific to credit cards
  }
  
  @override
  void validate(Map<String, dynamic> details) {
    // Credit card specific validation
  }
}
```

### 2. Factory Pattern
```dart
class PaymentMethodFactory {
  final HttpService _httpService;
  
  PaymentMethodFactory(this._httpService);
  
  PaymentMethod create(String type) {
    switch (type) {
      case 'credit_card':
        return CreditCardPayment(_httpService);
      case 'paypal':
        return PayPalPayment(_httpService);
      case 'bank_transfer':
        return BankTransferPayment(_httpService);
      default:
        throw UnsupportedPaymentTypeException(type);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Dependency Injection (DIP)
```dart
class PaymentProcessor {
  final PaymentMethodFactory _factory;
  final LoggerService _logger;
  final NotificationService _notifier;
  final TransactionRepository _repository;
  
  PaymentProcessor({
    required PaymentMethodFactory factory,
    required LoggerService logger,
    required NotificationService notifier,
    required TransactionRepository repository,
  }) : _factory = factory,
       _logger = logger,
       _notifier = notifier,
       _repository = repository;
       
  Future<PaymentResult> processPayment(PaymentRequest request) async {
    try {
      // Orchestrate the payment flow using injected dependencies
      final paymentMethod = _factory.create(request.paymentType);
      paymentMethod.validate(request.paymentDetails);
      
      final result = await paymentMethod.process(request);
      
      await _repository.save(result.transaction);
      await _logger.log('Payment processed: ${result.transactionId}');
      await _notifier.notify(request.customerEmail, result);
      
      return result;
    } catch (e) {
      await _logger.logError('Payment failed', e);
      rethrow;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Separation of Concerns (SRP)
Each class has one responsibility:
- **PaymentProcessor**: Orchestrates payment flow
- **PaymentMethod**: Processes specific payment type
- **LoggerService**: Handles logging
- **NotificationService**: Sends notifications
- **TransactionRepository**: Manages transaction storage
- **Validators**: Validate input data

### 5. Observer Pattern for Notifications
```dart
abstract class PaymentObserver {
  Future<void> onPaymentSuccess(PaymentResult result);
  Future<void> onPaymentFailure(PaymentError error);
}

class EmailNotificationObserver implements PaymentObserver {
  // Implementation
}

class LoggingObserver implements PaymentObserver {
  // Implementation
}
```
