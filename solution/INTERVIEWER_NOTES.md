# Interviewer Notes - 10 Minute OOP/SOLID/Patterns Assessment

## Pre-Interview Setup

1. ‚úÖ Ensure candidate has Dart SDK installed
2. ‚úÖ Open `payment_processor.dart` in their IDE
3. ‚úÖ Screen share or collaborative coding environment ready
4. ‚úÖ Have `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` open for reference
5. ‚úÖ Timer ready (10 minutes)

## Interview Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Welcome! Today you'll be refactoring a payment processing class that has several design issues. This is a 10-minute exercise where I want to see your understanding of OOP principles, SOLID principles, and design patterns.
>
> Please think aloud as you work‚Äîexplain what you're seeing and why you're making changes. Don't worry about finishing everything; I'm more interested in your thought process and prioritization.
>
> Take a moment to review the code, identify the issues, then start refactoring. Ready? Your 10 minutes starts now."

## Observation Checklist

### Strong Signals ‚úÖ

- [ ] Quickly scans the entire class (30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Identifies multiple issue categories (OOP, SOLID, patterns)
- [ ] Uses correct terminology (SRP, Strategy pattern, DIP, etc.)
- [ ] Explains the "why" not just the "what"
- [ ] Prioritizes high-impact changes
- [ ] Considers testability
- [ ] Asks clarifying questions about requirements
- [ ] Proposes abstractions before diving into code
- [ ] Mentions dependency injection
- [ ] Recognizes the if-else chain as OCP violation

### Red Flags üö©

- [ ] Only focuses on formatting/syntax
- [ ] Cannot articulate SOLID principles
- [ ] Makes changes without explanation
- [ ] Doesn't recognize any design patterns
- [ ] Suggests over-engineering (e.g., microservices for this)
- [ ] Gets stuck on minor details
- [ ] Cannot explain trade-offs
- [ ] Defensive when asked questions
- [ ] Doesn't know when to stop refactoring

## Expected Issues Identified (Minimum 5 for passing)

### OOP Violations (3 issues)
1. ‚¨ú Poor encapsulation (public fields: `apiKey`, `processedTransactions`)
2. ‚¨ú Missing abstraction (no payment method interface)
3. ‚¨ú No polymorphism (if-else instead of polymorphic dispatch)

### SOLID Violations (5 issues)
4. ‚¨ú **SRP**: Multiple responsibilities (validation, processing, logging, email, HTTP, fees, discounts)
5. ‚¨ú **OCP**: Must modify class to add new payment types
6. ‚¨ú **LSP**: No inheritance hierarchy (missed opportunity)
7. ‚¨ú **ISP**: No focused interfaces
8. ‚¨ú **DIP**: Depends on concrete implementations, no DI

### Design Patterns (2+ opportunities)
9. ‚¨ú Strategy pattern for payment methods
10. ‚¨ú Factory pattern for creating payment processors
11. ‚¨ú Observer pattern for notifications
12. ‚¨ú Decorator for fees/discounts

### Code Quality (3+ issues)
13. ‚¨ú Hardcoded credentials and paths
14. ‚¨ú Poor error handling (print statements)
15. ‚¨ú Code duplication across payment types
16. ‚¨ú Not testable (tight coupling)

## Probing Questions (Use When Needed)

### If Candidate is Stuck (2-3 minutes in)
- "What happens if we need to add a cryptocurrency payment method?"
- "How many responsibilities does this class have?"
- "How would you unit test this class?"

### If Moving Too Fast Without Explanation
- "Why did you choose that approach?"
- "What SOLID principle does this address?"
- "What pattern are you applying here?"

### If Going Too Deep on One Thing
- "Given the time constraint, what's your priority?"
- "Can you explain the high-level structure first?"
- "What's the most critical issue to fix?"

### If Finished Early (Rare)
- "How would you handle async operations?"
- "What security concerns should we address?"
- "How would this scale to 50 payment methods?"
- "Walk me through how you'd test your refactored code"

## Time Callouts

- **@ 3 minutes**: "You have 7 minutes remaining"
- **@ 7 minutes**: "You have 3 minutes left‚Äîconsider wrapping up and explaining what you've done"
- **@ 9 minutes**: "Last minute‚Äîplease summarize your approach"
- **@ 10 minutes**: "Time's up! Let's discuss what you've accomplished"

2. Proposes high-level architecture
3. Implements key abstractions (interfaces)
4. Demonstrates one pattern fully
5. Explains remaining changes

### Approach B: Incremental Refactoring (Common for Mid-Level)

4. Adds dependency injection
5. May run out of time

### Approach C: Bottom-Up (Junior)
1. Fixes small issues first
2. Extracts methods
3. Creates some classes
4. May miss big picture
5. Limited pattern usage

## Post-Interview Discussion (5 minutes)

### Questions to Ask
1. "What would you do differently with more time?"

3. "What was your biggest concern with the original code?"
4. "Which SOLID principle do you think is most important here?"
5. "Have you encountered similar issues in production code?"
